The guidelines provided are primarily section headings, topic descriptions, or general recommendations related to clinical development, pharmacovigilance, special populations, and PD/dose-response studies.\n\nUpon review, no guideline is explicitly violated by the content of the paragraph.\n1.  **Topic Headings (e.g., 2.1.2 a-f, 2.2, 3., 3.1, 14.3.4, 15., 2.6.2-2.6.5, 3. Addendum):** The paragraph does not contradict the existence or scope of these topics; it merely provides specific study data, which may or may not fully elaborate on all related topics. For example, the paragraph provides some \"Epidemiology\" data, which aligns with guideline 2.1.2 e, rather than violating it.\n2.  **Special Populations (4.3.3):** The guideline describes special populations and notes that studies may be conducted in any phase. The paragraph describes a Phase 3 study including adolescents (a special population), which is consistent with the guideline. Mentions of ICH documents (E5, E17, E6, E11) are informational or recommendatory (e.g., \"should be paid to ethical considerations\"). The paragraph's silence on whether these specific ICH guidelines were followed for consent in vulnerable populations is not an explicit contradiction of the guideline itself, which states *what should be paid attention to*, not that the paragraph *must describe* that attention.\n3.  **Pharmacodynamic/Dose Response Studies (VIII.):** The guideline states that routine PD studies are generally *not necessitated* in *geriatric patients* and recommends separate studies for specific drug types or if age-related differences are observed in geriatric vs. younger comparisons. The paragraph describes a PD study in *adult and adolescent* patients for haemophilia, which does not contradict the statements regarding geriatric patients or the specific recommended situations. The guideline does not state that PD studies are *only* permissible in the listed scenarios.\n\nThe validation adhered strictly to the \"EXPLICIT VIOLATIONS ONLY,\" \"NO INFERENCE,\" \"BENEFIT OF DOUBT,\" and \"NO FALSE POSITIVES\" rules. The paragraph's content does not contain any direct assertions or omissions that explicitly contradict any of the provided guidelines.",

The major toxicity identified in humans and animals is \nalopecia, and absorption and toxicity is considered high by the inhalation route (IPCS, 1996). Similar \nfindings may be expected by Tl exposure via oral and respiratory routes. For this reason, the inhalation \nPDE is set at the parenteral PDE. \n \nPDE = 8.0 µg/day \n \n\n \n\n---\n\n30 g/day\n\nReferences \n1.

In addition, quantitative \nmethods (M&S or statistical approaches) should be used to derive sample size for PK and/or \nbiomarker endpoints.

    "ai_reasoning": "The paragraph describes factual information about the conduct and outcomes of clinical pharmacology studies (PK/PD and bioequivalence). The provided guidelines cover various aspects such as reporting efficacy results, statistical/analytical issues, specific study objectives, and considerations for sample size and data collection.\n\nI applied the rules for violation strictly:\n1.  **EXPLICIT VIOLATIONS ONLY:** A guideline is violated ONLY if the paragraph explicitly contradicts it.\n2.  **NO INFERENCE:** Do not assume a violation if the paragraph is merely silent or vague.\n3.  **BENEFIT OF DOUBT:** If unsure, assume NO violation.\n4.  **NO FALSE POSITIVES.**\n\nUpon reviewing each guideline against the paragraph, no explicit contradictions were found. For instance:\n*   Guidelines related to \"EFFICACY RESULTS\" (11.4 and its subsections) are not violated because the paragraph is explicitly a \"Discussion on clinical pharmacology\" focusing on PK/PD, not efficacy analysis.\n*   The paragraph mentions dropouts/incomplete participation in Study B7841009. The guideline \"11.4.2.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data\" requires a description of *handling methods*. While the paragraph details the *occurrence* of dropouts, it is silent on *how* these were handled analytically. This silence, however, is not an *explicit contradiction* according to the \"NO INFERENCE\" rule.\n*   The guideline on sample size states \"quantitative methods... should be used to derive sample size\". The paragraph states the planned sample size but does not specify *how* it was derived. This is also a silence, not an explicit contradiction.\n*   The paragraph mentions \"Healthy male adults were recruited\" for two studies. No guideline explicitly prohibits recruiting only male adults in these types of Phase 1 studies or mandates gender diversity in all early phase trials.\n*   The guideline encouraging collection of genetic data is a recommendation (\"It is encouraged\"), and thus, its absence in the discussion is not a strict violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the paragraph describes the studies without explicitly stating anything contrary to the provided guidelines, even if it omits details that might be expected in a comprehensive report (which would fall under \"inference\" rather than \"explicit violation\").",

    "ai_reasoning": "The validation process was conducted under strict rules, requiring explicit contradictions for a guideline to be considered violated.\n\n1.  **Guidelines 1-11 (11.4 Efficacy Results and Tabulations...):** These guidelines describe the structure and content topics expected in a clinical study report. The paragraph is a specific section (\"2.6.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology\") of what is presumably a larger report. The paragraph itself does not explicitly state that these topics are not addressed elsewhere in the report, nor does it contradict the inclusion of these topics. Therefore, no violation is identified.\n2.  **Guidelines 12-16 (PBRER Appendix B – Examples of Summary Tabulations):** These guidelines provide examples of summary tables. The paragraph is narrative text, not a tabulation. It cannot violate rules pertaining to table structure or content by not being a table. Therefore, no violation is identified.\n3.  **Guidelines 17-32 (Type of Study Objective(s)...):** These guidelines describe objectives and examples for Human Pharmacology and Exploratory studies. The studies described in the paragraph (Study B7841001 as a PK/PD study and Study B7841009 as a bioequivalence study) align with the objectives and examples provided for Human Pharmacology studies (e.g., Rule 18: define/describe clinical PK and PD; Rule 23: BA/BE studies; Rule 25: Single and multiple-rising dose PK and/or PD studies). No explicit contradiction is found.\n4.  **Guidelines 33-34 (PK studies in ethnic groups):** Rule 33 states PK studies *should* be undertaken in major ethnic groups if differences are expected. The paragraph mentions \"4 Japanese participants\" in Study B7841001, which describes an action consistent with the guideline. It does not explicitly state that this was *not* done for the reasons outlined, nor does it contradict the guideline's intent. Therefore, no violation is identified.\n5.  **Guidelines 35-36 (Genetic data collection):** Rule 35 states it is *encouraged* to collect genetic data. The paragraph does not mention genetic data collection. As this is an encouragement and not a strict requirement, and no explicit statement negates its collection, this is not an explicit violation.\n6.  **Guidelines 37-39 (Biomarker effect):** The paragraph does not discuss biomarkers or their relationship to efficacy. There is no explicit contradiction of these guidelines within the provided text.\n7.  **Guidelines 40-43 (Sample size and data points):** Rule 41 states quantitative methods *should* be used to derive sample size. The paragraph provides participant numbers (planned vs. actual) but does not explicitly state that quantitative methods were *not* used for their derivation, nor does it describe an alternative non-quantitative method. Similarly, Rule 43 concerning timing and number of data points is not explicitly contradicted; the paragraph is silent on this detail. Therefore, no explicit violation is identified.\n8.  **Guideline 44 (Analysis and reporting):** This rule states data used in the analysis *should* be described. The paragraph describes the collection of \"PK/PD data\" and \"PK data\" and mentions participants \"contributed data for the calculation of PK parameters.\" This constitutes a description of the data. Therefore, no explicit violation is identified.\n\nIn summary, based on the strict interpretation of \"explicit contradictions only\" and \"no inference,\" no violations were found in the provided paragraph against the given guidelines.",

    "ai_reasoning": "The paragraph describes two Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, including details on participant demographics, study design, and data collected (PK/PD). The provided guidelines cover various aspects such as efficacy results analysis, PBRER tabulation examples, objectives/examples of different study types (human pharmacology, exploratory), and general principles for PK studies and data collection/analysis.\n\nNo explicit violations were identified based on a strict interpretation of the rules:\n- **Efficacy Rules (11.4.x):** The paragraph is a \"Discussion on clinical pharmacology\" and does not claim to report efficacy results, so these rules are not directly applicable.\n- **PBRER Tabulations (Appendix B):** These are examples for *tables*, and the paragraph is *prose*. There is no contradiction.\n- **Human Pharmacology Objectives/Examples:** The paragraph describes studies that align with or do not explicitly contradict these objectives/examples. For instance, Study B7841001 is a single ascending dose PK/PD study, which aligns with defining/describing clinical PK/PD and being a single-rising dose PK/PD study. Omissions (e.g., not mentioning drug interactions or cardiac toxicity assessments) are not considered explicit violations based on the \"NO INFERENCE\" rule.\n- **PK studies in ethnic groups (Rule Q):** The paragraph mentions the inclusion of \"4 Japanese participants\" in one cohort. This indicates some consideration of ethnic groups, and it does not explicitly state that other major ethnic groups were ignored, or that the overall requirement was not met. Thus, no explicit contradiction.\n- **Genetic Data (Rule S):** This guideline states it is \"encouraged,\" not a mandatory requirement, so silence on this point is not a violation.\n- **Biomarker Rules (T, U, V):** These rules apply if the study relies on biomarker effect for efficacy. The paragraph discusses PK/PD, but not specifically \"biomarker effect and efficacy\" in a way that triggers these rules.\n- **Sample Size Derivation (W, X):** The paragraph reports sample sizes but does not discuss the quantitative methods used for their derivation or considerations for data points. This is an omission, not an explicit contradiction.\n- **Data Description (Rule Y):** The paragraph describes the data collected (PK/PD, specific details for each study), which fulfills the requirement to describe the data used in the analysis.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph is silent on many aspects covered by the guidelines, but it does not *explicitly contradict* any of the stated rules.

Healthy male adults were recruited for the phase 1 first-in-human single ascending dose Study B7841001 and for the phase 1 bioequivalence Study B7841009. Study B7841001 investigated the PK/PD of Marstacimab at different dose levels (30 to 440 mg) in 6 cohorts with either SC or IV administration (cohort 1: 30 mg SC, N=4; cohort 2: 196 mg SC, N=7; cohort 3: 300 mg SC, N=6; cohort 4: 150 mg IV, N=6; cohort 5: 440 mg IV, N=6; cohort 6: 300 mg SC, 4 Japanese participants). A total of 9 healthy individuals received Placebo. Study B7841009 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single dose, 4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover study in healthy adult male participants and compared the PK of a pre-filled syringe (used for the phase 3 trial) with a pre-filled pen. Both presentations are intended for marketing. Only PK data were collected during this bioequivalence study. While 38 participants (19 participants per sequence) were planned to be enrolled to have approximately 34 evaluable participants, only 22 participants were actually enrolled due to the occurrence of an event of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism leading to termination of the study. A total of 18 participants completed at least 1 period and contributed data for the calculation of PK parameters for PFS and PFP.

The paragraph, being a factual description of clinical trials, did not explicitly contradict these conditions or general principles.\n- For guidelines like \"11.4.2.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data,\" while the paragraph described the *occurrence* of dropouts and missing data, it did not explicitly state that these were *not handled*, nor did it claim to describe the handling when it did not. Therefore, it did not explicitly contradict the guideline.\n- For the guideline \"PK studies should be undertaken in the major ethnic groups...\", the paragraph described the recruitment of \"healthy male adults\" and \"4 Japanese participants\" in one study. This description does not explicitly state that other major ethnic groups were *not* included, nor does it provide information about whether differences were expected, which is a condition of the guideline.",

Study B7841009 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single dose, 4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover study in healthy adult male participants and compared the PK of a pre-filled syringe (used for the phase 3 trial) with a pre-filled pen. Both presentations are intended for marketing. Only PK data were collected during this bioequivalence study. While 38 participants (19 participants per sequence) were planned to be enrolled to have approximately 34 evaluable participants, only 22 participants were actually enrolled due to the occurrence of an event of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism leading to termination of the study. A total of 18 participants completed at least 1 period and contributed data for the calculation of PK parameters for PFS and PFP.

It exists primarily in two oxidation states: +1 and +3. \nMonovalent thallium is similar to potassium (K+) in ionic radius and electrical charge, which contributes \nto its toxic nature. Many of the thallium salts are soluble in water with the exception of the insoluble \nTl(3+) oxide. Thallium sulfate has been used in medicine, primarily as a depilatory agent, but also to \ntreat infections, such as venereal diseases, ringworm of the scalp, typhus, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nTl(3+) salts are being used in organic synthesis. Thallium is nutritionally not essential and no metabolic \nfunction is known (ATSDR, 1992). \nSafety Limiting Toxicity \nIn humans and animals, the skin, especially the hair follicles, appears to be the most sensitive target of \ntoxicity from repeated oral exposure to thallium (US EPA, 1992; US EPA, 2009). Water soluble salts \n(sulphate, acetate, or carbonate) have higher toxicity than other forms (Moore et al, 1993). \nPDE – Oral Exposure \nThe primary target organ for oral exposure to thallium in humans and animals appears to be the skin, \nespecially the hair follicles, as shown in a 90-day toxicity rat study with thallium sulfate. The NOAEL \nwas defined at 0.04 mg Tl/kg on the basis of an increased incidence of alopecia at the higher doses \n(OEHHA, 1999; US EPA, 2009). Thus, the oral PDE was determin",

The impact of \nethnic factors upon a medicine’s effect will vary depending upon the drug’s \npharmacologic class and indication and the age and gender of the patient. No one \nproperty of the medicine is predictive of the compound’s relative sensitivity to ethnic \nfactors. The type of bridging study needed is ultimately a matter of judgement but \nassessment of sensitivity to ethnic factors may help in that judgement. \nThe following properties of a compound make it less likely to be sensitive to ethnic \nfactors: \n• Linear pharmacokinetics (pK) \n• A flat pharmacodynamic (PD) (effect-concentration) curve for both efficacy and \nsafety in the range of the recommended dosage and dose regimen (this may mean \nthat the medicine is well-tolerated) \n• A wide therapeutic dose range* (again, possibly an indicator of good tolerability) \n• Minimal metabolism or metabolism distributed among multiple pathways \n• High bioavailability, thus less susceptibility to dietary absorption effects \n• Low potential for protein binding \n• Little potential for drug-drug, drug-diet and drug-disease interactions \n• Non-systemic mode of action \n• Little potential for inappropriate use \nThe following properties of a compou\n\n---\n\nEthnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data \n• \nCharacterization in a population relevant to the new region of the \npharmacokinetics, and where possible, pharmacodynamics and dose response for \npharmacodynamic endpoints. This characterization could be performed in the \nforeign region in a population representative of the new region* or in the new \nregion*. \nSeveral ICH guidelines that address aspects of design, conduct, analysis and \nreporting of clinical trials will help implement the concepts of the Complete Clinical \nData Package. These guidances include GCP’s (E6), evaluation of dose response (E4), \nadequacy of safety data (E1 and E2), conduct of studies in the elderly (E7), reporting \nof study results (E3), general considerations for clinical trials (E8), and statistical \nconsiderations (E9). A guidance on the choice of control group in clinical trials (E10) is \nunder development. \n2.1 \nAdditional \nStudies \nto \nMeet \nthe \nNew \nRegion’s \nRegulatory \nRequirements \nWhen the foreign clinical data do not meet the regional regulatory requirements, the \nregulatory authority may require additional clinical trials such as: \n• \nclinical trials in different subsets of the population such as patients with renal \ninsufficiency, patients with hepatic dysfunction, etc. \n• \nclinical trials using different comparators at the new region’s approved dosage and \ndose regimen \n• \ndrug-drug interaction studies \n3.\n\n---\n\nThe world-wide experience should be briefly discussed, including: \n• \nThe extent of the world-wide exposure; \n• \nAny new or different safety issues identified; \n• \nAny regulatory actions related to safety. \nb. \nPopulations not Studied in the Pre-Approval Phase \nThe Specification should discuss which populations have not been studied or have only \nbeen studied to a limited degree in the pre-approval phase. The implications of this with \nrespect to predicting the safety of the product in the marketplace should be explicitly \ndiscussed (CTD 2.5.5). Populations to be considered should include (but might not be \nlimited to): \n• \nChildren; \n• \nThe elderly; \n• \nPregnant or lactating women; \n• \nPatients with relevant co-morbidity such as hepatic or renal disorders; \n• \nPatients with disease severity different from that studied in clinical trials; \n• \nSub-populations carrying known and relevant genetic polymorphism; \n• \nPatients of different racial and/or ethnic origins. \nc. \nAdverse Events (AEs) / Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) \nThis section should list the important identified and potential risks that require further \ncharacterisation or evaluation. Specific references should be made to guide a reviewer to \nwhere clinical safety data are presented (e.g., relevant sections of the CTD 2.5.5 and \n2.7.4). \nDiscussion of risk factors and potential mechanisms that apply to identified AEs/ADRs \nshould draw on information from any part of the CTD (non-clinical and clinical) and \nother releva\n\n---\n\nVII. Pharmacokinetics in Renally or Hepatically Impaired Patients\nRenal impairment is an aging-associated finding that can also occur in younger \npatients. Therefore, it is a general principle, not specific to these guidelines, \nthat drugs excreted (parent drug or active metabolites) significantly through \nrenal mechanisms should be studied to define the effects of altered renal \nfunction on their pharmacokinetics. Such information is needed for drugs that \nare the subject of this guideline but it can be obtained in younger subjects with \nrenal impairment. \nSimilarly, drugs subject to significant hepatic metabolism and/or excretion, or \nthat have active metabolites, may pose special problems in the elderly. \nPharmacokinetic studies should be carried out in hepatically- impaired young or \nelderly patient volunteers.\n\n---\n\nEthnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data \nPopulation Representative of the New Region \nA population that includes the major racial groups within the new region. \nPharmacokinetic Study \nA study of how a medicine is handled by the body, usually involving measurement of \nblood concentrations of drug and its metabolite(s) (sometimes concentrations in urine \nor tissues) as a function of time. Pharmacokinetic studies are used to characterize \nabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a drug, either in blood or in \nother pertinent locations. When combined with pharmacodynamic measures (a PK/PD \nstudy) it can characterize the relation of blood concentrations to the extent and timing \nof pharmacodynamic effects. \nPharmacodynamic Study \nA study of a pharmacological or clinical effect of the medicine in individuals to \ndescribe the relation of the effect to dose or drug concentration. A pharmacodynamic \neffect can be a potentially adverse effect (anticholinergic effect with a tricyclic), a \nmeasure of activity thought related to clinical benefit (various measures of betablockade, effect on ECG intervals, inhibition of ACE or of angiotensin I or II \nresponse), a short term desired effect, often a surrogate endpoint (blood pressure, \ncholesterol), or the ultimate intended clinical benefit (effects on pain, depression, \nsudden death). \nPopulation Pharmacokinetic Methods \nPopulation \npharmacokinetic methods are a population-based evaluation of \nmeasurements o",

The MAH is not expected to record exposures during \npregnancy for products specifically indicated for use during pregnancy, if not associated \nwith an AE/ADR. AEs/ADRs, such as abnormal outcome following parental exposure, \nincluding congenital anomalies, potential epigenetic responses, developmental disorders \nin the foetus or child, foetal death, spontaneous abortion, or AEs/ADRs in the mother or \nnew-born, are subject to ICSR reporting requirements. \n\n---\n\npregnancy-specific outcome data systematically is needed to evaluate the impact of the \ninvestigational product on maternal and fetal/infant/child health.

Acquiring data on medicinal products \nduring early pregnancy is only likely to occur in trials that have no requirement for \ncontraception. These trials will be important to help characterize the product’s safety profile in \npregnancy unless there is a good rationale for not doing so. \n4.2.1 \nStudy Design and Implementation \nWhile this guideline focuses mainly on the inclusion of pregnant individuals in interventional \nclinical trials, other trial types may be acceptable if they are appropriate for inclusion of \npregnant individuals. The sponsor should carefully consider which study design would be most \nappropriate for the evaluation of an investigational product in pregnant individuals. \nAdditionally, the safety impact on the pregnancy by all products used within the trial (i.e., test \nand comparator products) should be considered. \n4.2.2 \nExpertise Considerations \nGiven the specialist knowledge required for investigational product and disease impacts on \npregnancy, embryo-fetal development, and neonatology, consultation with relevant specialist \n(e.g., obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine \n\n---\n\nwhether and how treating the underlying health condition with the investigational product \nbenefits the pregnancy. \nInterpretation of the causality of AEs in the infant exposed to investigational product in utero \nshould be made with caution in instances where the sample size is small or if there is no control \narm. Possible confounders should also be considered. Additionally, the pregnancy trimester of \nexposure should be considered when evaluating any associations between exposure and \noutcome, (e.g., neural tube defects are unlikely to result from third trimester exposures). \nExternal reference rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the general population may be \nhelpful to provide context.

There is a range of \npotential CMC changes for which communication between a company and the \nregulatory authority is required. CMC changes vary from low to high potential risk \nwith respect to product quality, safety, and efficacy. A well-characterised, risk-based \ncategorisation of regulatory communication requirements is important to the efficient \nuse of industry and regulatory resources. \nIn such a regulatory system, the types of CMC changes that occur during the \ncommercial phase of the pharmaceutical product lifecycle that invoke communication \nwith regulatory authorities are classified with regard to the potential to have an adverse \neffect on product quality of the drug product. The regulatory communication category, \nsupporting information/documentation requirements, and associated time frame for \nevaluation are commensurate with that potential risk. Based on potential risk, an \ninspection may be needed. \nRegulatory authorities are encouraged to utilise a system that incorporates risk-based \nregulatory processes for (a) requesting prior approval from the regulatory authority, (b) \nnotifying the regulatory authority, or (c) simply recording CMC changes, with \nassociated information requirements and, where applicable, timeframes for decision. \nSuch a system would include the followi\n\n---\n\nThe PACMP is a regulatory tool that provides predictability regarding the \ninformation required to support a CMC change and the type of regulatory \nsubmission based on prior agreement between the MAH and regulatory \nauthority.

    "guidelines_input": "Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration \nNonetheless, even for life-threatening diseases, drug developers should always be \nweighing the gains and disadvantages of varying regimens and considering how best \nto choose dose, dose-interval and dose-escalation steps. Even in indications involving \nlife-threatening diseases, the highest tolerated dose, or the dose with the largest effect \non a surrogate marker will not always be the optimal dose. Where only single dose is \nstudied, blood concentration data, which will almost always show considerable \nindividual variability due to pharmacokinetic differences, may retrospectively give \nclues to possible concentration-response relationships. \nUse of just a single dose has been typical of large-scale intervention studies (e.g. postmyocardial infarction studies), because of the large sample sizes needed. In planning \nan intervention study, the potential advantages of studying more than a single dose \nshould be considered. In some cases it may be possible to simplify the study by \ncollecting less information on each patient, allowing study of a larger population \ntreated with several doses without significant increase in costs. \nRegulatory Considerations When Dose-Response Data Are Imperfect \nEven well-laid plans are not invariably successful. An otherwise well-designed doseresponse study may have utilized doses that were too high, or too close together, so \nthat all appear equivalent (albeit superior to placebo). In that\n\n---\n\nIV. GUIDANCE AND ADVICE\n1. \nDose-response data are desirable for almost all new chemical entities entering the \nmarket. These data should be derived from study designs that are sound and \nscientifically based; a variety of different designs can give valid information. The \nstudies should be well-controlled, using accepted approaches to minimize bias. In \naddition to carrying out formal dose-response studies, sponsors should examine \nthe entire database for possible dose-response information. \n2. \nThe information obtained through targeted studies and analyses of the entire \ndatabase should be used by the sponsor to: \na. \nIdentify a reasonable starting dose, ideally with specific adjustments (or a \nfirm basis for believing none is needed) for patient size, gender, age, \nconcomitant illness, and concomitant therapy, reflecting an integration of \nwhat is known about pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. \nDepending on circumstances (the disease, the drug’s toxicity) the starting \ndose may range from a low dose with some useful effect to a dose that is at or \nnear the full-effect dose. \nb. \nIdentify reasonable, response-guided titration steps, and the interval at \nwhich they should be taken, again with appropriate adjustments for patient \ncharacteristics. These steps would be based either on the shape of the typical \nindividual’s dose-effect curves (for both desirable and undesirable effects), if \nindividual dose-response data were available, or if not, on the shape of t\n\n---\n\nDose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration \nminimum number of patients. For example, the first marketing of zidovudine (AZT) \nfor treatment of people with AIDS was based on studies at a high dose; later studies \nshowed that lower doses were as effective and far better tolerated. The urgent need \nfor the first effective anti-HIV treatment made the absence of dose-response \ninformation at the time of approval reasonable (with the condition that more data \nwere to be obtained after marketing), but in less urgent cases this approach is \ndiscouraged. \nInteractions between Dose-Response and Time \nThe choice of the size of an individual dose is often intertwined with the frequency of \ndosing. In general, when the dose interval is long compared to the half-life of the \ndrug, attention should be directed to the pharmacodynamic basis for the chosen \ndosing interval. For example, there might be a comparison of the long dose-interval \nregimen with the same dose in a more divided regimen, looking, where this is feasible, \nfor persistence of desired effect throughout the dose-interval and for adverse effects \nassociated with blood level peaks. Within a single dose-interval, the dose-response \nrelationships at peak and through blood levels may differ and the relationship could \ndepend on the dose interval chosen. \nDose-response studies should take time into account in a variety of other ways. The \nstudy period at a given dose should be long enough for the full effect to be reali\n\n---\n\nThe decision to include an adolescent cohort in an adult clinical trial assumes the disease, drug \npharmacology, and response to treatment are sufficiently similar between the adolescent and \nadult patients. As such, the objective(s) of including adolescents and adults in a single trial \nshould be framed within the context of the extrapolation concept. Additional data to inform \nadolescent dosing may not be necessary as adolescent and adult PK are generally similar. In \nsuch situations, specific consideration pertaining to the impact of lower body weight on dosing \nin adolescents should be carefully considered. In cases when there is a wide safety margin, \nhigher exposures may be acceptable in the adolescents with lower body weight compared to \nadults when administered the same recommended adult fixed dose.\n\n---\n\n9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for each Patient\nProcedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/investigational product and \nactive control/comparator should be described. These procedures can vary from \nsimple random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to some specified \ntitration procedure, to more elaborate response-determined selection procedures, e.g., \nwhere dose is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or some specified \nendpoint is achieved. Procedures for back-titration, if any, should also be described. \nThe timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should \nbe described, and if it was not specified, this should be noted. \nAny specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should be \ndescribed.",

For \nother considerations on initial dosing \nin humans, e.g., predicted PD \nactivity, regional guidance should be \nconsulted.\n\n---\n\n2.2.2.2 \nPharmacokinetic Analysis \nFor single-dose studies, the following PK parameters should be tabulated for each subjectformulation combination: 1) primary parameters for BE analysis: AUC(0-t), Cmax, and, where \napplicable, early exposure parameters (see Section 2.1.8.3), and 2) additional parameters for \nanalysis to assess the acceptability of the bioequivalence study: AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-t)/AUC(0-inf), tmax, \nkel, and t1/2. For single-dose studies, AUC(0-t) should cover at least 80% of AUC(0-inf). If the AUC(0t)/AUC(0-inf) percentage is less than 80% in more than 20% of the observations, then the validity of \nthe study may need to be discussed in the submission. If the AUC is truncated at 72 hours for long \nhalf-life drugs, the primary AUC parameter for analysis is AUC(0-72h) and the following additional \nparameters are not required: AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-t)/AUC(0-inf), kel, and t1/2. \nSummary statistics to be reported include number of observations, geometric mean, coefficient of \nvariation, median, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Each PK \nparameter should be calculated using the actual time of sampling for each concentration data point. \nThe non-compartmental methods used to derive the PK parameters from the raw data should be \nreported, e.g., linear trapezoidal method for AUC and the number of data points of the terminal \nlog-linear phase used to estimate kel. \nFor multiple-dose studies, applicants should document appropriate dosage administratio\n\n---\n\n5.2 Reporting DDI Results\nTypical pharmacokinetic endpoints for DDI studies should include changes in drug exposure \nparameters for the substrate drug, such as AUC, Cmax, and, when applicable, Cmin (see section \n5.1.1). Pharmacokinetic results of DDI studies should be reported as the geometric mean ratio of \nthe observed pharmacokinetic exposure measures with and without the precipitant drug and the \nassociated 90 percent confidence interval. Measures of the observed variability of the interaction, \nsuch as the range of AUC or Cmax ratios for individuals in a cross-over study, should be reported. \n\nThere are multiple methods of displaying the data, and sponsors are encouraged to select the most \nappropriate methods based on the data and the situation. Data can be displayed graphically, for \nexample, by using forest plots. A comparison of the individual pharmacokinetic parameters with \nand without concomitant medication can also be presented graphically (e.g., as spaghetti plots or \nindividual ratio plots). The proportion of individuals for whom exposure extends beyond the noeffect boundary (see section 5.3.1) can also be presented.",

Because of a \ngeneral lack of index precipitants for transporter-mediated pathways, the choice of transporter \nprecipitant is generally based on the likelihood of concomitant use (e.g., to obtain clinically \nrelevant DDI information that can inform labeling regarding the management of a DDI). Some \nexamples are provided in Section 7.7.3.2, Table 19.\n\n---\n\nEvaluating the potential of an investigational drug as an object of a metabolic enzyme- or \ntransporter-mediated DDI involves identification of the principal routes of the drug’s elimination. \nFor drugs whose major elimination routes are not urinary excretion of unchanged parent drug or \nthat are not biologics eliminated through unspecific catabolism, the keystone of the identification \nof principal elimination routes is a well-performed clinical mass balance study. In some instances, \n(e.g., if a large part of the dose is found as unchanged parent drug in feces), an absolute \nbioavailability study can also be a useful complement to aid interpretation of principal elimination. \nUsing data from the mass balance study, the quantitative contributions of the different elimination \npathways should be estimated based on the amount of dose excreted as primary and secondary \nmetabolites along specific routes. For quantitatively important elimination pathways, in vitro and \nclinical studies should be used to identify the main enzymes and/or transporter proteins involved \nin these pathways. The ability to predict interactions affecting the investigational drug is dependent \non the identification of these proteins.\n\n---\n\nRenal uptake transporters (Organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, and Organic cation \ntransporter (OCT)2) and renal efflux transporters (Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1 \nand MATE2-K) are often involved in active renal secretion of drugs. In vitro studies to evaluate a \ndrug as a substrate of these transporters should be considered if the drug clearance by renal active \nsecretion is ≥25% of its systemic clearance. Assuming there is no reabsorption (e.g., passive \nreabsorption is equal to passive secretion, and there is no active reabsorption), active secretion \nclearance can be calculated as (CLr – (fu,p  GFR)), where GFR is glomerular filtration rate and \nCLr is renal clearance.

Thus, the possibility of \nbeing a substrate of P-gp and/or BCRP is often evaluated in vitro for investigational drugs given \norally. Because P-gp and BCRP are also expressed in the liver (P-gp, BCRP) and kidneys (P-gp), \nan in vitro study should be considered for a drug if biliary excretion or active renal secretion is a \nmajor elimination pathway of the drug. In addition, evaluating P-gp- and BCRP-mediated transport \nmay be useful in the assessment of the drug’s brain penetration. \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 are important hepatic uptake \ntransporters.

Even in indications involving \nlife-threatening diseases, the highest tolerated dose, or the dose with the largest effect \non a surrogate marker will not always be the optimal dose. Where only single dose is \nstudied, blood concentration data, which will almost always show considerable \nindividual variability due to pharmacokinetic differences, may retrospectively give \nclues to possible concentration-response relationships. \nUse of just a single dose has been typical of large-scale intervention studies (e.g. postmyocardial infarction studies), because of the large sample sizes needed. In planning \nan intervention study, the potential advantages of studying more than a single dose \nshould be considered. In some cases it may be possible to simplify the study by \ncollecting less information on each patient, allowing study of a larger population \ntreated with several doses without significant increase in costs. \nRegulatory Considerations When Dose-Response Data Are Imperfect \nEven well-laid plans are not invariably successful.

These data should be derived from study designs that are sound and \nscientifically based; a variety of different designs can give valid information. The \nstudies should be well-controlled, using accepted approaches to minimize bias. In \naddition to carrying out formal dose-response studies, sponsors should examine \nthe entire database for possible dose-response information. \n2. \nThe information obtained through targeted studies and analyses of the entire \ndatabase should be used by the sponsor to: \na. \nIdentify a reasonable starting dose, ideally with specific adjustments (or a \nfirm basis for believing none is needed) for patient size, gender, age, \nconcomitant illness, and concomitant therapy, reflecting an integration of \nwhat is known about pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. \nDepending on circumstances (the disease, the drug’s toxicity) the starting \ndose may range from a low dose with some useful effect to a dose that is at or \nnear the full-effect dose. \nb. \nIdentify reasonable, response-guided titration steps, and the interval at \nwhich they should be taken, again with appropriate adjustments for patient \ncharacteristics. These steps would be based either on the shape of the typical \nindividual’s dose-effect curves (for both desirable and undesirable effects), if \nindividual dose-response data were available, or if not, on the shape of t\n\n---\n\nDose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration \nminimum number of patients. For example, the first marketing of zidovudine (AZT) \nfor treatment of people with AIDS was based on studies at a high dose; later studies \nshowed that lower doses were as effective and far better tolerated. The urgent need \nfor the first effective anti-HIV treatment made the absence of dose-response \ninformation at the time of approval reasonable (with the condition that more data \nwere to be obtained after marketing), but in less urgent cases this approach is \ndiscouraged. \nInteractions between Dose-Response and Time \nThe choice of the size of an individual dose is often intertwined with the frequency of \ndosing. In general, when the dose interval is long compared to the half-life of the \ndrug, attention should be directed to the pharmacodynamic basis for the chosen \ndosing interval. For example, there might be a comparison of the long dose-interval \nregimen with the same dose in a more divided regimen, looking, where this is feasible, \nfor persistence of desired effect throughout the dose-interval and for adverse effects \nassociated with blood level peaks. Within a single dose-interval, the dose-response \nrelationships at peak and through blood levels may differ and the relationship could \ndepend on the dose interval chosen. \nDose-response studies should take time into account in a variety of other ways. The \nstudy period at a given dose should be long enough for the full effect to be reali\n\n---\n\nThe decision to include an adolescent cohort in an adult clinical trial assumes the disease, drug \npharmacology, and response to treatment are sufficiently similar between the adolescent and \nadult patients. As such, the objective(s) of including adolescents and adults in a single trial \nshould be framed within the context of the extrapolation concept. Additional data to inform \nadolescent dosing may not be necessary as adolescent and adult PK are generally similar. In \nsuch situations, specific consideration pertaining to the impact of lower body weight on dosing \nin adolescents should be carefully considered. In cases when there is a wide safety margin, \nhigher exposures may be acceptable in the adolescents with lower body weight compared to \nadults when administered the same recommended adult fixed dose.\n\n---\n\n9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for each Patient\nProcedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/investigational product and \nactive control/comparator should be described. These procedures can vary from \nsimple random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to some specified \ntitration procedure, to more elaborate response-determined selection procedures, e.g., \nwhere dose is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or some specified \nendpoint is achieved. Procedures for back-titration, if any, should also be described. \nThe timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should \nbe described, and if it was not specified, this should be noted. \nAny specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should be \ndescribed.",

To be eligible for this biowaiver \nof additional strengths, specific criteria apply in terms of dose proportionality in PK, formulation \nproportionality, and dissolution profile similarity in specific dissolution conditions. \nM13B is intended to reduce the need for in vivo BE studies for additional strengths by \nrecommending the specific criteria needed to pursue a biowaiver of such studies. \n\n---\n\n1.2 Background\n1.2.1 \nBioequivalence \nBE for IR solid oral dosage forms with systemic action is largely established via clinical \npharmacokinetic (PK) BE studies or comparative in vitro dissolution studies. In addition to the \noral dosage forms stated above, the PK principles of this guideline are generally applicable to, for \ninstance, orally administered solutions if BE studies are deemed necessary, and non-orally \nadministered drug products in which reliance on systemic exposure measures is suitable for \nestablishing BE, e.g., certain rectal, inhalation, and nasal drug products. \nBE assessment for these oral dosage forms is important for establishing therapeutic equivalence \nfor generic drug products to their respective comparator products. In addition, there may be \nsituations in new (innovator) drug development when demonstration of BE may be critical for \npivotal developmental and approval decisions. Furthermore, BE studies are used by innovator and \ngeneric product developers for supporting post-approval formulation and/or manufacturing \nprocess changes. \nTwo drug products containing the same drug(s) are considered bioequivalent if their relative \nbioavailability (BA) (rate and extent of drug absorption) after administration in the same molar \ndose lies within acceptable predefined limits. These limits are set to ensure comparable in vivo \nperformance, i.e., similarity in terms of safety and efficacy. \nThe Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaiver ma\n\n---\n\n1.3 Scope\nThe scientific and technical aspects of study design and data analysis to support BE assessment \nbased on PK endpoints for orally administered IR solid dosage forms have been described in ICH \nM13A, Guideline on Bioequivalence for Immediate-release Solid Oral Dosage Forms. \nM13B, the second guideline in the series, describes the scientific and technical aspects of\n\n---\n\n1000 mg/kg\nlimit dose \nreached?\nMean exposure \nmargin ≥10x clinical?\nHuman Dose \n<1 gram/day?",

Other cutoff values can be proposed if \njustified based on in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation and a calibration of the specific in vitro systems \nwith known inhibitors and non-inhibitors of these transporter systems. \n\nIf the above analysis indicates that a drug inhibits a transporter, a clinical study should be \nconsidered based on whether the likely concomitant medications used in the indicated patient \npopulations are known substrates of the inhibited transporter and the safety profiles of those \nsubstrates. Alternatively, the inhibition potential of a drug can be evaluated using mechanistic \nstatic models, PBPK modeling, or endogenous biomarkers. These approaches should be supported \nby submission of evidence supporting validity of the methods.\n\n---\n\nEvaluating the potential of an investigational drug as an object of a metabolic enzyme- or \ntransporter-mediated DDI involves identification of the principal routes of the drug’s elimination. \nFor drugs whose major elimination routes are not urinary excretion of unchanged parent drug or \nthat are not biologics eliminated through unspecific catabolism, the keystone of the identification \nof principal elimination routes is a well-performed clinical mass balance study. In some instances, \n(e.g., if a large part of the dose is found as unchanged parent drug in feces), an absolute \nbioavailability study can also be a useful complement to aid interpretation of principal elimination. \nUsing data from the mass balance study, the quantitative contributions of the different elimination \npathways should be estimated based on the amount of dose excreted as primary and secondary \nmetabolites along specific routes. For quantitatively important elimination pathways, in vitro and \nclinical studies should be used to identify the main enzymes and/or transporter proteins involved \nin these pathways. The ability to predict interactions affecting the investigational drug is dependent \non the identification of these proteins.",

    "guidelines_input": "4.3.4 Post-Approval Studies\nAfter the approval of a drug, additional studies may be conducted to further understand the \nsafety and efficacy of the drug in its approved indication (usually referred to as phase 4). These \nare studies that were not considered necessary for approval but are often important for \noptimising the drug's use. They may be of any type but should have valid scientific objectives. \nPost-approval studies may be conducted to address a regulatory requirement. \nPost-approval studies may be performed to provide additional information on the efficacy, \nsafety, and use of the drug in populations more diverse than included in the studies conducted \nprior to marketing authorisation. Studies with long-term follow-up or with comparisons to other \ntreatment options or standards of care may provide important information on safety and \nefficacy. Commonly conducted studies include additional drug-drug interaction, dose-response \nor safety studies and studies designed to support use under the approved indication (e.g., \nmortality/morbidity studies, epidemiological studies). These studies may explore use of the \ndrug in the real-world setting of clinical practice and may also inform health economics and \nhealth technology assessments.\n\n---\n\n4.3 Clinical Studies\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence \nthat builds on knowledge accumulated from non-clinical and previous clinical studies. The \nstructure of the drug development programme will be shaped by many considerations and \ncomprised of studies with different objectives, different designs, and different dependencies. \nThe Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although \nclinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 14), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, \nand that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined. \nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early \nstages of development and to plan an appropriate development programme based on this \nprofile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early \nevaluation of short-term safety and tolerability as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These \nstudies may provide pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and other information needed to \nchoose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. \nAs more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, \nmay include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in \naddition to \n\n---\n\n4.3.2 Exploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology and \ndose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) \nare conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the \nnature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or\n\n---\n\n4.2 Non-Clinical Studies\nGuidance on non-clinical safety studies is provided in ICH M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies, ICH \nSafety (S) Guidelines and related Q&A documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, \npharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may \nencompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and \nsimulation). The scope of non-clinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, \ndepend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug’s chemical or \nmolecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); \nroute(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME); \nphysiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; \nmetabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., \npregnant or breast-feeding women, children) may require additional non-clinical assessments. \nGuidance for non-clinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special \npopulations should be reviewed (see, e.g., ICH S5 Reproductive Toxicology, S11 Nonclinical \nPaediatric Safety, and M3). \nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects \nof the drug, serve to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans.
