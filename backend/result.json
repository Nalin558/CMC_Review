Study B7841001 investigated the PK/PD of Marstacimab at different dose levels (30 to 440 mg) in 6 cohorts with either SC or IV administration (cohort 1: 30 mg SC, N=4; cohort 2: 196 mg SC, N=7; cohort 3: 300 mg SC, N=6; cohort 4: 150 mg IV, N=6; cohort 5: 440 mg IV, N=6; cohort 6: 300 mg SC, 4 Japanese participants). A total of 9 healthy individuals received Placebo. Study B7841009 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single dose, 4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover study in healthy adult male participants and compared the PK of a pre-filled syringe (used for the phase 3 trial) with a pre-filled pen. Both presentations are intended for marketing. Only PK data were collected during this bioequivalence study.",

Adequate PK comparisons between subpopulations known to be \nassociated with differences in PK will allow for decisions with respect to the need for \npharmacodynamic studies and dose-response studies in different regions and/or subpopulations. \n\nIt is encouraged to collect genetic data (e.g., genotypes of drug metabolising enzymes) \nfrom subjects enrolled in the early studies to examine the effects of genetic factors on PK \nand PD. Such early data may provide useful information when determining dosing regimen(s) for future studies, where subjects with specific genotypes may be considered a \nsubpopulation.\n\n---\n\nIn order to rely on the use of dose/exposure to achieve a biomarker effect, it is important to \nhave confidence that there is a relationship between the biomarker effect and efficacy in the \nreference population. Models could investigate the mechanistic basis for selected biomarkers, \nfacilitate the analysis of biomarker data, and optimize the data collection needed to support \nand/or confirm the relationship between the biomarker and clinical efficacy in the reference \npopulation (see sections 4.1.5 and 4.1.6). A therapeutic range of the biomarker effect that \nprovides a meaningful assessment of similarity of response between the reference and target \npopulations should be defined in the extrapolation plan. \nSample size \nIn general, sample size considerations described in section 4.2.1 apply. In addition, quantitative \nmethods (M&S or statistical approaches) should be used to derive sample size for PK and/or \nbiomarker endpoints. The sample size for the study can vary depending on the variability in \nPK and biomarkers. Consideration of the timing and number of data points per participant for \nboth PK and biomarkers should determine the appropriate sampling. \nAnalysis and reporting \nThe data used in the analysis should be described, with a focus on the important elements \nrelevant to the objectives of the analysis, e.g.., the comparison between the biomarker effect in \nthe target population and that in the reference population.",
