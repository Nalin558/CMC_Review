In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated. For example, weight of extractable per weight of component material (e.g., \n\u00b5g/g) or weight of extractable per extraction solution volume (e.g., \u00b5g/mL) are commonly used"}], "cmc_hits": [{"meta": {"file": "hympavzi-epar-public-assessment-report_en (2).pdf", "heading": "Assessment report", "id": "CMC-65"}, "score": 0.3711714744567871, "text": "Assessment report \nEMA/464842/2024 \nPage 23/195 \nEvolution of analytical method was described and does not give rise to questions. \nIn-Process Extractables and Leachables \nA risk assessment was performed for all marstacimab active substance in-process contact materials.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated. For example, weight of extractable per weight of component material (e.g., \n\u00b5g/g) or weight of extractable per extraction solution volume (e.g., \u00b5g/mL) are commonly used"}], "cmc_hits": [{"meta": {"file": "hympavzi-epar-public-assessment-report_en (2).pdf", "heading": "Assessment report", "id": "CMC-65"}, "score": 0.3711714744567871, "text": "Assessment report \nEMA/464842/2024 \nPage 23/195 \nEvolution of analytical method was described and does not give rise to questions. \nIn-Process Extractables and Leachables \nA risk assessment was performed for all marstacimab active substance in-process contact materials.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated. For example, weight of extractable per weight of component material (e.g., \n\u00b5g/g) or weight of extractable per extraction solution volume (e.g., \u00b5g/mL) are commonly used"}], "cmc_hits": [{"meta": {"file": "hympavzi-epar-public-assessment-report_en (2).pdf", "heading": "Assessment report", "id": "CMC-65"}, "score": 0.3711714744567871, "text": "Assessment report \nEMA/464842/2024 \nPage 23/195 \nEvolution of analytical method was described and does not give rise to questions. \nIn-Process Extractables and Leachables \nA risk assessment was performed for all marstacimab active substance in-process contact materials.

If PPND/ePPND study data are available and have shown clinically relevant \nsystemic exposures in offspring during the postnatal period, these data can contribute to the \nWoE evaluation (see Section 1.4). For ePPND studies conducted in the non-human primate \n(NHP), the data from the offspring can characterise toxicity during early postnatal development, \nprovided relevant exposure and/or PD effects are confirmed in the offspring. \nWhen available, PPND/ePPND data should be evaluated in combination with data from the \ngeneral toxicity studies in assessing the potential added value of conducting additional \nnonclinical investigations. Maternal and fetal tolerance of the drug should be considered \nbecause they could influence interpretation of the findings in offspring. Observations of adverse \neffects in offspring would not, on their own, indicate that a JAS is recommended. However, if \na safety concern was identified in the PPND/ePPND study, it should be considered in the WoE \nevaluation.

When a study is deemed warranted, the specifics of the identified \nsafety concerns should define the aim of the nonclinical investigation; this could be a JAS or \nanother study (e.g., in vitro or ex vivo investigations). For a JAS, the study objectives should \nbe aligned with the WoE outcome and the intended paediatric use.

In at least one of these studies, \ndosing should start at an age developmentally matched to the lowest age of the intended patient \npopulation. In principle, chronic studies that start dosing from ages that developmentally \ncorrelate to the youngest paediatric patient age can be sufficient to cover all ages and durations \nof paediatric use. These can replace adult animal chronic studies and a separate JAS. Further \nnonclinical assessments of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenic potential can be warranted. \nWhen studies in juvenile animals are warranted for biopharmaceuticals, these should be limited \nto relevant species, as per ICH S6. Non-invasive safety pharmacology endpoints can be \nincluded in the juvenile or standard NHP repeated-dose studies. Genotoxic and carcinogenic \npotential should be addressed as outlined in ICH S6. \nA JAS in postweaning NHP is typically conducted in animals starting at 10 to 12 months of \nage, thus limiting the coverage of the lowest paediatric age ranges. A JAS in preweaning NHP \nshould only be conducted in the situation of pharmaceuticals with first and primarily neonatal \nclinical use, and where alternative approaches to nonclinical safety assessment are not feasible. \nStudies with direct dosing of NHPs prior to weaning can require large numbers of mature dams \nto populate even a relatively small JAS.

Based \non these data, it cannot be fully excluded that inhibition of TFPI could hinder these tumour suppressive \neffects. However, a thorough weight of evidence evaluation, in combination with data from the repeat dose \ntoxicity studies, which included exposure to marstacimab up to 26 weeks, does not suggest any carcinogenic \npotential.

Specifically, marstacimab dosing \nwas initiated 4 weeks prior to mating, throughout mating, and was subsequently continued until euthanasia. \nDuring this period, 11 injections were administered.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated.

If the model will be updated in the future, it is recommended to further investigate ADAs as the timevarying variable. \nOverall, the provided updated population PK model seems to describe the observed data well for doses of 150 \nmg SC QW and lower and much better for the 300mg dose compared to the previously submitted model. \nHowever, the predicted values diverge from the observed values especially for higher concentrations and seem \nto underpredict higher concentrations. Although this is a shortcoming of the model, this might also be due to \nthe limited data and could improve if further data might be integrated in the future. \nThe updated PK/PD model describes the data well also for higher concentrations. \nHigher variability was noted in adolescent patients, but this might be due to the low number of patients in this \nage group. The Applicant did not discuss a potential effect of any other covariates nor were any explicitly tested \nin the PKPD model, which might be acceptable, if no effect is expected but no justification was provided. \nHowever, differences in free, total TFPI or peak thrombin might be explained by covariates also already included \nin the popPK model. \nResults of the covariate analysis based on the popPK model are described further below (PK in special \npopulations). \nBioanalytical assays \nFully validated assays were used for determination of marstacimab drug concentrations (PK), total plasma TFPI \n(PD) and detection of ADA and NAb.

For ePPND studies conducted in the non-human primate \n(NHP), the data from the offspring can characterise toxicity during early postnatal development, \nprovided relevant exposure and/or PD effects are confirmed in the offspring. \nWhen available, PPND/ePPND data should be evaluated in combination with data from the \ngeneral toxicity studies in assessing the potential added value of conducting additional \nnonclinical investigations.

In at least one of these studies, \ndosing should start at an age developmentally matched to the lowest age of the intended patient \npopulation.

Non-invasive safety pharmacology endpoints can be \nincluded in the juvenile or standard NHP repeated-dose studies. Genotoxic and carcinogenic \npotential should be addressed as outlined in ICH S6. \nA JAS in postweaning NHP is typically conducted in animals starting at 10 to 12 months of \nage, thus limiting the coverage of the lowest paediatric age ranges.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION THRESHOLD \nThe AET is not a control threshold, but rather a threshold corresponding to a concentration \nabove which extractables or leachables should be identified, quantitated, and reported for safety \nassessment, forming the foundation of the overall E&L risk assessment and control strategy. \nThe ICH guidelines on impurities in new drug substances (ICH Q3A) and impurities in new \ndrug products (ICH Q3B), describe a series of predetermined thresholds based upon maximum \ndaily dosing that are intended to provide adequate control over critical quality attributes that \nmay impact the safety and efficacy of the drug product over the course of the product shelflife. In contrast, this guideline recommends incorporation of a Safety Concern Threshold (SCT; \nsee Section 6 Safety Assessment) to first establish a study-specific AET. \nAn extraction study should include the establishment and application of an AET to indicate \nextractable chemical entities to be detected, identified and reported as potential leachables for \nthe drug product. For a leachable study, the AET is established at a concentration above which \ncompounds should be identified and quantitated to enable appropriate safety assessment. For \nClass 1 leachables (See Appendix 4, Table A.4.1), the compound-specific safety limit, instead \nof a product-specific SCT, should be used for quantification. \nDerivation of the study-specific AET depends on dosing considerations (e.g., maximum dose \nlevel, frequency of dosing, and duration of treatment). The AET may be expressed using \nvarious units of measure depending on the type of study (extractable vs leachable) and what is \nbeing evaluated.

Overall, the non-compendial analytical \nmethods have been appropriately validated for their suitability for intended use according to ICH Q2(R1). \nReference Standard \nFor commercial manufacturing, the Applicant established a two-tiered reference standard system. The \nprimary reference material (PRM) and the working reference material (WRM) are derived from the active \nsubstance (AS) by the commercial manufacturing process. . A bridging study was performed to ensure \ncorrect potency/biological activity assignment of the PRM against the previous clinical reference material \n(CRM). Thus, the traceability of potency values from clinical material to commercial material is appropriately \nestablished. Furthermore, an acceptable protocol for the preparation of future reference materials was \nprovided. \nBatch Analyses \nRelease results of all manufactured batches were provided and conformed to release criteria that were in \nplace at the respective time. Overall, the results appear consistent. Comparability between process variants \nwas appropriately established."}]}}

Subcutaneous (SC) multiple dose cohorts were \nenrolled starting at the 300 mg SC dose. Intravenous (IV) routes of administration were not evaluated in the \nstudy. Participants were enrolled and assigned to the study treatments in four cohorts: Cohort 1 (non\ninhibitor, n = 8) with 300 mg weekly s.c. dosing, Cohort 2 (non-inhibitor, n = 6) with 300 mg loading dose \nfollowed by 150 mg weekly s.c. dosing, Cohort 3 (non-inhibitor, n = 6) with 450 mg weekly s.c. dosing. The \ninhibitor cohort (Cohort 4) was treated with 300 mg weekly s.c. dosing, which was assessed as safe and well\ntolerated in participants without inhibitors before treatment of inhibitor patients was initiated. \nCohorts were followed for at least 29 days. If available safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data \nthrough Day 29 were permissive for dose escalation, a cohort at a higher dose level was to be opened for \nenrollment. Alternatively, a cohort at a lower dose level was to be opened if data were supportive. In \naddition, if the dose level under review was safe and well tolerated through Day 29, treatment was to \ncontinue for the participants in that respective cohort during the subsequent 2 months (Day 30 to Day 85). \nEligible participants were patients with severe haemophilia A or B (FVIII or FIX activity \u22641%) with on\ndemand treatment regimen, including those with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. \nFor efficacy evaluation, frequency and annualised rate of bleeding episodes from day 1 to day 85 were \ninvestigated as the key secondary endpoint of the study. Information on bleeding episodes over the 6 months \nprior to the study were collected at screening, information on new bleeding episodes after screening were \ncollected continuously to day 113 (FU/EOS). Additionally, a historical on-demand group was constructed \nusing data from the following internal Pfizer studies: ReFacto AF 3082B2-4432 (B1831004), BeneFIX \nB1821010, and BeneFIX 3090A1-400 (B1821004)."}}

Study B7841009 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single dose, 4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover study in healthy adult male participants and compared the PK of a pre-filled syringe (used for the phase 3 trial) with a pre-filled pen. Both presentations are intended for marketing. Only PK data were collected during this bioequivalence study.\n "}}

A total of 9 healthy individuals received Placebo. Study B7841009 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single dose, 4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover study in healthy adult male participants and compared the PK of a pre-filled syringe (used for the phase 3 trial) with a pre-filled pen. Both presentations are intended for marketing. Only PK data were collected during this bioequivalence study. While 38 participants (19 participants per sequence) were planned to be enrolled to have approximately 34 evaluable participants, only 22 participants were actually enrolled due to the occurrence of an event of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism leading to termination of the study. A total of 18 participants completed at least 1 period and contributed data for the calculation of PK parameters for PFS and PFP. A total of 11 participants completed all 4 periods and contributed data for the statistical analysis of the PK parameters."}}

A comparable Cmax (18.5\u00b5g/mL) was observed in the Cynomolgus monkey study (number\n8299672) after SC administration of marstacimab at 3mg/kg. Similar values were reported following single\ndose subcutaneous administrations of 300mg to healthy study participants (Cmax 16490ng/mL and\n12870ng/mL in study B7841001 and B7841009, respectively) and patients with haemophilia (17110ng/mL\nand 15610ng/mL in study B7841002 and B7841010, respectively).
